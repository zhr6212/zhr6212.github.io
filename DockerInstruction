#this file contain 2 service. First one is DB(database) and second one is WordPress.
1.	Image:  means the image used for the service, for example. Db use mysql:5.7and WordPress use the newest WordPress version. 
2.	Volumes: means mount this service to a directory. Allowing you to modify the code on the fly, without having to rebuild the image
3.	Restart: always means always restart.
4.	Environment: means set the environment variable.(user, password, rootpassword etc…)
5.	Depends_on: in WordPress service means the order of service to start. WordPress depends on db.so the db. should start first because WordPress depends on it.
